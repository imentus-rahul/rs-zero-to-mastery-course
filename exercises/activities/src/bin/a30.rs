// Topic: Generics & Structures
//
// Requirements:
// * Create a Vehicle structure that is generic over traits Body and Color
// * Create structures for vehicle bodies and vehicle colors and implement the
//   Body and Color traits for these structures
// * Implement a 'new' function for Vehicle that allows it to have any body
//   and any color
// * Create at least two different vehicles in the main function and print their
//   info
//
// Notes:
// * Examples of car bodies can be Truck, Car, Scooter
// * Examples of colors could be red, white, black
// * It is not necessary to have data fields or function implementations
//   for the vehicle bodies/colors
